#### Q3. When should you use the two-sample t-test? When must the modified version of the test be applied? 

#### Q4. What is the rationale for using a pooled estimate of the variance in the two-sample t-test? 

#### Q7. The following data come from a study that examines the efficacy of saliva cotinine as an indicator for exposure to tobacco smoke. In one part of the study, seven subjects -- none of whom were heavy smokers and all of whom had abstained from smoking for at least one week prior to the study -- were each required to smoke a single cigarette. Samples of saliva were taken from all individuals 2, 12, 24, and 48 hours after smoking the cigarette. The cotinine levels at 12 hours and at 24 hours are shown below : 

**Cotinine Levels (nmol/l)**

| subject | After 12 Hours | After 24 Hours |
| ------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| 1       | 73             | 24             |
| 2       | 58             | 27             |
| 3       | 67             | 49             |
| 4       | 93             | 59             |
| 5       | 33             | 0              |
| 6       | 18             | 11             |
| 7       | 147            | 43             |

#### Let $\mu_{12}$ represent the population mean cotinine level 12 hours after smoking the cigarette and $\mu_{24}$ the mean cotinine level 24 hours after smoking. It is believed that $\mu_{24}$ must be lower than $\mu_{12}$. 

(a) Construct a one-sided 95% confidence interval for the true difference in population means $\mu_{12}-\mu_{24}$ .

(b) Test the null hypothesis that the population means are identical at the $\alpha = 0.05$ level of significance. What do you conclude?
