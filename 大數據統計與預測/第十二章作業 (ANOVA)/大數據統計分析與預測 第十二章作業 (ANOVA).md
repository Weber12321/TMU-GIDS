###### Q2. What is the idea behind the one-way analysis of variance? What two measures of variation are being compared?

It is aimed to compare *k* groups' difference of *means*.



###### Q5. Consider the $F$ distribution with 8 and 16 degrees of freedom.

###### (a) What proportion of the area under the curve lies to the right of $F$ = 2.99?

###### (b) What value of $F$ cuts off the up	per 1% of the distribution?

###### (c) What proportion of the area under the curve lies to the left of $F$ =4.52?



###### Q7. A study of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes was conducted to investigate the effects of cigarette  smoking on renal and retinal complications. Before examining the result of the study, you wish to compare the baseline measure of systolic blood pressure across four different subgroups : nonsmokers, current smokers, ex-smokers, and tobacco chewers. A sample is selected from each subgroup；the relevant data are shown below. Means and standard deviations are expressed in $mm\:Hg$. <u>Assume that systolic blood pressure is normally distributed.</u> 

|                 | n    | $\overline{x}$ | s    |
| --------------- | ---- | -------------- | ---- |
| Nonsmokers      | 269  | 115            | 13.4 |
| Current Smokers | 53   | 114            | 10.1 |
| Ex-smokers      | 28   | 118            | 11.6 |
| Tobacco Chewers | 9    | 126            | 12.2 |

###### (a) Calculate the estimate of the within-groups variance.

###### (b) Calculate the estimate of the between-groups variance.

###### (c) At the 0.05 level of significance, test the null hypothesis that the mean systolic blood pressures of the four groups are identical. What do you conclude?

###### (d) If you find that the population means are not all equal, use the Bonferroni multiple comparisons procedure to determine where the differences lie. What is the significance level of each individual test?



###### Q8. One of the goals of the Edinburgh Artery Study was to investigate the risk factors for peripheral arterial disease among persons 55 to 74 years of age. You wish to compare mean LDL cholesterol levels, measured in $mmol/liter$, among four different populations of subjects : patients with intermittent claudication or interruptions in movements, those with major asymptomatic disease, those with minor asymptomatic disease, and those with no evidence of disease at all. Samples are selected from each population；summary statistics are shown below.  

|                            | n    | $\overline{x}$ | s    |
| -------------------------- | ---- | -------------- | ---- |
| Intermittent Claudication  | 73   | 6.22           | 1.62 |
| Major Asymptomatic Disease | 105  | 5.81           | 1.43 |
| Minor Asymptomatic Disease | 240  | 5.77           | 1.24 |
| No Disease                 | 1080 | 5.47           | 1.31 |

###### (a) Test the null hypothesis that the mean LDL cholesterol levels are the same for each of the four populations. What are the degrees of freedom associated with this test? 

###### (b) What do you conclude?

###### (c) What assumptions about the data must be true for you to use one-way analysis of variance technique?

###### (d) Is it necessary to take an additional step in this analysis? If so, what is it? Explain.
