#### Chapter 8 

##### 1. What is statistical inference?



##### 4. What is a standard error of a sample mean? How does the standard error compare standard deviation of the population? 



##### 5. Explain the central limit theorem.



##### 6. What happens to the amount of sampling variability among a set of sample means $$ \overline{\rm x_1}, \overline{\rm x_2},\overline{\rm x_3}, ...$$ as the size of the samples increases?  



##### 8. Among adults in the United states, the distribution of albumin levels (type of a protein) in cerebrospinal fluid is roughly symmetric with $$\mu=29.5\: mg/100ml $$ and the standard deviation $$\sigma= 9.25\:mg/100ml$$ . Suppose that you select repeated samples of size 20 from this population and calculate the mean for each sample. 

##### (a) If you were to select a large number of random samples of size 20, what would be the mean of the samples mean? 

##### (b) What would be their standard deviation? What is another name for this standard deviation of the sample means?
