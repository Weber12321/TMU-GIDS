###### Q3. What is a p-value? What does the p-value mean in words?



###### Q7. Explain the analogy between type I and type II errors in a test of hypothesis and the false positive and false negative results that occur in diagnostic testing. 



###### Q9. The distribution of diastolic blood pressures for the population of female diabetics between the ages of 30 and 34 has an unknown mean $$\mu_d$$and standard deviation $$\sigma_d = 9.1 \:mm\:Hg$$ . It may be useful to physicians to know whether the mean of this population is equal to the mean diastolic blood pressure of the general population of females in this group, $$74.4 \:mm\:Hg$$.

(a) What is the null hypothesis of the appropriate test?

(b) What is the alternative hypothesis?

(c) A sample of ten diabetic women is selected；their mean diastolic blood pressure is $$\overline{x}_d = 84 \:mm\:Hg$$ . Using this information, conduct a two-sided test at the $$\alpha = 0.05$$ level of significance. What is the p-value of the test?

(d) What conclusion do you draw from the results of the test?

(e) Would your conclusion have been different if you had chosen $$\alpha = 0.01$$ instead of $$\alpha = 0.05$$ ?

###### Q11. Body mass index is calculated by dividing a person's weight by the square of his or her height；it is a measure of the extent to which the individual is overweight. For the population of middle-aged men who later develop diabetes mellitus, the distribution of baseline body mass indices is approximately normal with an unknown mean $$\mu$$ and standard deviation $$\sigma$$ . A sample of 58 men selected from this group has mean $$\overline{x} = 25 \: kg/m^2$$ anb the standard deviation $$s = 2.7 \: kg/m^2$$.

(a) Construct a 95% confidence interval for population mean $$\mu$$ .

(b) At the 0.05 level of significance, 

(c)

(d)
