#### 1. The  frequentist definition of probability :

	If an experiment is repeated n times under essentially identical conditions, and if the event A occurs m times, then as n grows large, the ratio m/n approaches a fixed limit that is the probability of A.



#### 3. Mutually exclusive vs independent events :

	If variables are  mutually exclusive, we can say the intersection is a null-event, that is, they absolutely cannot both happen in the same time. For example, when tossing a coin, the result can either be heads or tails but cannot be both.
	
	Otherwise, if variables are independent, it means that the occurrence of variable A won't influence variable B. For example, when tossing two coins, the result of one flip does not affect the result of the other. 



#### 8. Mexican-American birth research :

Probability of infant's gestational age > 37 weeks is, $$P(A)=0.142$$ 
Probability of infant's birth weight > 2500 grams is, $$P(B)=0.051$$
Both conditions occurrence probability is, $$P(A ⋂ B)=0.031$$

##### (a) Plot a Venn's graph to illustrate the conditions :

##### (b) Are A and B independent? 

	If A and B are indepentent, mathematically, 
$$ { A ⋂ B } = A \times B $$
$$ A \times B = 0.142 \times 0.051 = 0.007242 $$

	But we have known that from the data : 
$${ A ⋂ B } = 0.031$$ 

	The outcome is, A and B aren't insependent.   



##### (c) For a randomly selected M-American newborn, what is the P that A or B or both occur ?

	The answer is the union of probability of both A and B, that is,

$$ { A  ⋃  B } 
= (A + B) - { A ⋂ B } 
= ( 0.142 + 0.051 ) - 0.031
= 0.162
$$



##### (d) What is the probability that event A occurs given that event B occurs?

	Mathematically, We have to calculate P( A | B )，and P(B) should not be 0
$$ P( A | B ) = \frac { P( A ⋂ B ) }{ P( B ) } = \frac {0.031}{0.051} = 0.6078431$$



#### 9. Natality Statistics of American, 1992

|    Age    | Probability |
| :-------: | :---------: |
|  **<15**  |    0.003    |
| **15-19** |    0.124    |
| **20-24** |    0.236    |
| **25-29** |    0.290    |
| **30-34** |    0.220    |
| **35-39** |    0.085    |
| **40-44** |    0.014    |
| **45-49** |    0.001    |
| **Total** |    1.000    |

Since the total probability is the sum of all probability and each row won't influence each other, so we consider those data are **independent** and **mutually exclusive** .

##### (a) What is the probablility of women giving birth >= 24 yrs old?

	We have to add up first 3 values that are under 24 of the table :
$$ Answer :0.003+0.124+0.236= 0.363 $$



##### (b) What is the probability that she was 40 or older?

	We have to add up last 2 values that are higher than 40 of the table :
$$ Answer :0.014 + 0.001 = 0.015 $$


##### (c) We want to calculate P(A|B), that A is mother who was not 20 yet, B was mother under 30 yrs old.

$$ P( A | B ) = \frac { P( A ⋂ B ) }{ P( B ) } = \frac {(0.003+0.124) \times (0.03+0.124+0.236+0.29)}{0.03+0.124+0.236+0.29} = 0.127$$



##### (d) We want to calculate P(A|B), that A is mother who was under 40 , B was mother older than 35 yrs old.

$$ P( A | B ) = \frac { P( A ⋂ B ) }{ P( B ) } = \frac { 0.085 \times (0.085+0.014+0.001)}{0.085+0.014+0.001} = 0.085$$



#### 13. A sensitive of a screening test of detecting the breast cancer is 0.85, while its specificity is 0.80.

$$ Sensitive =  P(T^+|D^+)$$

$$ Specificity =  P(T^-|D^-)$$

##### (a) Probability of FN?

$$FN = P(T^-|D^+) = 1 - Sensitive = 1 - P(T^+|D^+) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$$

##### (b) Probability of FP?

$$FP = P(T^+|D^-) = 1 - Specificity = 1 - P(T^-|D^-) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$$

##### (c) $$P(D^+) = 0.0025$$, what is the probability that the woman has cancer given that her mammogram is positive?

$$P(D^+|T^+) = \frac{P(D^+⋂T^+)}{P(T^+)} = \frac{P(T^+ |D^+)P(D^+)}{P(T^+ | D^+ )P(D^+ ) + P(T^+ | D^- )P(D^- )} = \frac{0.085 \times 0.0025}{0.085 \times 0.0025 + 0.20 \times (1-0.0025)} = 0.00106403$$



#### 15. Radionuclide ventriculograhy - diagnostic test for detecting coronary artery disease

|           | Disease | Disease |       |
| --------- | ------- | ------- | ----- |
| **Test**  | Present | Absent  | Total |
| +         | 302     | 80      | 382   |
| -         | 179     | 372     | 551   |
| **Total** | 481     | 452     | 933   |

##### (a) Sensitive? Specificity?

$$ Sensitive =  P(T^+|D^+) = \frac {P(T^+⋂D^+)}{P(D^+)} = \frac{302}{481} = 0.6278586$$

$$ Specificity =  P(T^-|D^-) = \frac {P(T^-⋂D^-)}{P(D^-)} = \frac{372}{452} = 0.8230088$$

##### (b) $$P(D^+)=0.10$$ , calculate the one has disease given that he or she $$T^+$$  

$$P(D^+|T^+) = \frac{P(D^+⋂T^+)}{P(T^+)} = \frac{0.6278586 \times 0.10}{0.6278586 \times 0.10 + (1-0.8230088) \times (1-0.10)} = 0.2827199$$

##### (c) What is the $$P(T^-)$$?

$$P(T^-)=\frac{551}{933}=0.5905681$$



#### 19. A community-base study of respiratory illness during the first year of life, north American

| Socioeconomic status | Number of children | Number with symptoms |
| :------------------: | :----------------: | :------------------: |
|         Low          |         79         |          31          |
|        Middle        |        122         |          29          |
|         High         |        192         |          27          |

##### (a) Probability suffering from the persistent respiratory illness symptoms in each socioeconomic status.

$$P(L)=\frac{31}{79}=0.3924051$$

$$P(M)=\frac{29}{122}=0.2377049$$

$$P(H)=\frac{27}{192}=0.140625$$

##### (b) odd ratio

$$OR(L)=\frac{0.3924051}{1-0.3924051}=0.6458334$$

$$OR(M)=\frac{0.2377049}{1-0.2377049}=0.3118279$$

$$OR(H)=\frac{0.140625}{1-0.140625}=0.1636364$$

##### (c) Did the status really matter?

	Yeah, there is negative association between socioeconomic status and respiratory symptoms since the higher the status is, the lower the odd ratio of the symptoms is.
