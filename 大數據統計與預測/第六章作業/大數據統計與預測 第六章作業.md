##### 1. The  frequentist definition of probability :

ANS

	If an experiment is repeated n times under essentially identical conditions, and if the event A occurs m times, then as n grows large, the ratio m/n approaches a fixed limit that is the probability of A.

##### 3. Mutually exclusive vs independent events :

ANS

	If variables are  mutually exclusive, we can say the intersection is a null-event, that is, they absolutely cannot both happen in the same time. For example, when tossing a coin, the result can either be heads or tails but cannot be both.
	
	Otherwise, if variables are independent, it means that the occurrence of variable A won't influence variable B. For example, when tossing two coins, the result of one flip does not affect the result of the other. 

##### 8. Mexican-American birth research :

Probability of infant's gestational age > 37 weeks (A): 0.142
Probability of infant's birth weight > 2500 grams (B): 0.051
Both conditions occurrence probability ({ A ⋂ B }): 0.031

###### (a) Plot a Venn's graph to illustrate the conditions :

ANS

###### (b) Are A and B independent? 

ANS

	If A and B are indepentent, mathmetically, { A ⋂ B } = A x B
	A x B = 0.142 x 0.051 = 0.007242 != { A ⋂ B }
	So, A and B aren't insependent.

###### (c) For a randomly selected M-American newborn, what is the P that A or B or both occur ?
