+ neuron study 
+ fly brain - how to get those data into connectome data? The total slice image data of fly brain is in 2 TB
+ image processing pipeline : using AI based neuron feature extraction
+ Knowledge based neuron extraction
+ case study : FlyCircuit database
+ case study : fly connectome database  - segmentation of the neuron 
+ 3D neuron tracing : neuron reconstruction , using HDR threshold, high brs. one threshold can give u whole neuron segment, the high score brs means that branch is more important. It can reduce 82% work to neuron segmentation applying such AI work. Break point in the confocal neuron image.
+ auto labeling of training data, leNet CNN, using model to find the breakpoint in the fiber of the neuron system
+ break point mislabeling, between overlap in human labeling and the NR model  
+ Recover split segments with breakpoint result
+ U-Net neuron segmentation : boundary prediction from the training data of raw image and segmentation map 
+ EM neuron reconstruction with U-Net?
