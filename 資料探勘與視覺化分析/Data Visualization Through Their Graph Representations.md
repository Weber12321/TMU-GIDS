### Summary

What is the main purpose of this chapter? 

### Introduction

+ Owing to the breakthrough of the advances in data collection ,computer and storage technologies, the data gaining is constantly increased.

+ Some say, since we are thinking with our left-brain logical and right-brain sensual, it is well-believed that finding out the trends and patterns via huge amount of structured data by visual techniques is much more better to let human gain insights immediately by their bare eyes.

+ In this chapter, we focus on the visual exploration of data through their graph representation. And,a rigorous mathematical frame work based on optimizing an objective function is introduced that results in a graph layout. Several examples are used to illustrate the techniques.

### Data and Graphs

+ Graphs are useful entities since they can represent relationships between sets of objects. They are used to model complex systems  and to visualize relationships. 
	+ for instance, in statistics and data analysis,
